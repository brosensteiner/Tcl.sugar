# Tcl.sugar

this sugar has the goal to be the ultimate Tcl IDE for MacRabbitÂ´s Espresso 2.0 (complete code sense and syntax highlighting of all Tcl built-in procedures, options and switches - mostly  auto-generated with a script from the Tcl 8.6 manual and when needed tuned by hand). This Sugar also provides all typical Espresso Sugar "bells and whistles" (navigator view, code folding ...). So if someone has suggestions or questions please let me know and [email me](mailto:brosensteiner@gmail.com)

**IMPORTANT:** In order to use some of the text actions the [ShellActions-sugar](https://github.com/onecrayon/ShellActions-sugar) is needed
and if you want regex syntax highlighting in "regexp" and "regsub" commands you need the [regex.sugar](https://github.com/elliottcable/regex.sugar)

## Installation

Copy/Paste the following in terminal:

```bash
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Sugars
    git clone git://github.com/brosensteiner/Tcl.sugar.git
```
