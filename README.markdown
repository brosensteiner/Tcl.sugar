#Tcl.sugar

this sugar has the goal to be the ultimate Tcl IDE in the future, so if someone has suggestions or questions please let me know and [email me](mailto:brosensteiner@gmail.com)

**IMPORTANT:** In order to use some of the text actions the [ShellActions-sugar](https://github.com/onecrayon/ShellActions-sugar) is needed
and if you want regex syntax highlighting in "regexp" and "regsub" commands you need the [regex.sugar](https://github.com/elliottcable/regex.sugar)
